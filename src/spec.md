# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the landing page hero description copy to remove “the” from the phrase “the banter”.

**Planned changes:**
- Modify the Hero section description text so “the banter” becomes “banter”, leaving the rest of the sentence unchanged.

**User-visible outcome:** The landing page hero description no longer contains the phrase “the banter” and instead reads “banter” in the same sentence.
