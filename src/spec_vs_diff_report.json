  "summary": "Diff adds production configuration and smoke-test documentation, plus backend/frontend code changes, but does not provide evidence of an actual production deployment or completed post-deploy smoke test, and introduces UI/content elements that were not requested for a deployment-only task.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Deploy Version 33 to production on the Internet Computer, upgrading both backend and frontend asset canisters using the existing single-actor backend architecture.",
      "reason": "The diff shows documentation additions and code changes, but no evidence of production deployment actions/config (e.g., canister IDs, dfx deploy commands, CI/CD, release scripts) or that the frontend asset canister/backend canister were actually upgraded in production.",

      "requirement": "Frontend loads successfully in production and routes render (/, and all /offers/* pages).",
      "reason": "There is no evidence in the diff summary of a production deployment validation (only a checklist/doc). Code-splitting is mentioned, but not proof of production routing working.",

      "reason": "Documentation describes how to configure reCAPTCHA and post-deploy steps, but the diff summary does not show an explicit statement of the current production configuration status (configured vs not configured) as required by the acceptance criteria.

      "reason": "BuildRequest is deployment-only with a non-goal of adding new product features; a country code dropdown/calling code content is not needed to deploy Version 33 and appears unrelated to the stated contact form fields (name/email/message only).",
