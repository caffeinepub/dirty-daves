REQ-4 and REQ-5 are not evidenced in the provided SMOKE_TEST_PRODUCTION.md truncation / other docs. The diff summary also indicates multiple unrequested frontend code/UI changes (and updates to project metadata) that violate the stated constraint to limit changes to static assets and documentation.",
